I'm supposed to snoop, especially around 
<span class='red'>${holiday}</span> time! What <span class='red'>${person1}</span> doesn't 
snoop? I just so happened to be in our 
<span class='red'>${place}</span>. Normally I'm not up there, it's 
<span class='red'>${adj1}</span> and <span class='red'>${adj2}</span>. Plus there are 
<span class='red'>${animals}</span>, yuck! I couldnt help myself! 
There it was right by my little sister's 
old <span class='red'>${noun1}</span>. Guess <span class='red'>${person2}</span> didn't think 
I would <span class='red'>${verb1}</span> it. I <span class='red'>${verbed}</span> it, 
it felt <span class='red'>${adj3}</span>. Should I <span class='red'>${verb2}</span> it? 
Looking closer I saw some <span class='red'>${nouns}</span>. 
I got even closer and <span class='red'>${pastVerb}</span> a

<span class='red'>${verbing}</span>!`;
